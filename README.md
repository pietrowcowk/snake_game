# Game Description
In the Snake, the player controls the movement of a snake with the up/down/left/right keyboard keys. The aim is to move the snake towards a target food to eat it, without id hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
